# NASA Data Visualization App

## Description

This React application fetches data from NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API and displays it in a chart using Google Charts. The app allows users to filter the data based on certain criteria and provides a table view of the data with a switcher to toggle between the chart and the table. Additionally, a CSV Download button is available for users to download the displayed data in CSV format.
